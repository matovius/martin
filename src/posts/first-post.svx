Hi, my name is Martin Matovu, a web developer hailing from a small landlocked African country called Uganda.

If this is your first time on my website, welcome! It's lovely to have you. Hope you like it here. There's barely anything for now, but I hope this place becomes a hub for sharing my interests and thoughts.

This is the first blog post, of hopefully many more to come (as long as I don't do the thing where I rapidly lose interest like a deflating balloon). It's just an introduction, and a hopeful look at what might be coming next on this blog.

## What's this blog about?

Great question! I have no idea.

I'm hoping to write about all my interests here, from web dev to science. Anything that I find interesting, I'll probably be writing about here.

It's gonna be mostly web dev stuff, and how I use Svelte as my framework of choice, but hopefully even more than that. Otherwise it's gonna be science and technology commentary that's hopefully not gonna lead to bad stuff (i.e. *mis-* and *dis-* information).

But I hope to share more constructive and creative ideas and thoughts on this blog here. If you're interested, be sure to tune in whenever I decide to write something, because I don't have a set schedule or anything. I'm just trying to get something set here, but we'll see where it all goes.

So thank you for reading, I appreciate your eyeballs and your brain. Glad to have entertained you for a couple minutes that you'll never regain in your life.

Take care âœŒ
